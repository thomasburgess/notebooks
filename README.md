# notebooks

This repository is to store some of my [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks.

**Guns** is looking at us gun deaths, loosely based on a [dataquest](dataquest.io) example using [fivethirtyeight](fivethirtyeight.com) data.

**Recommendation Engine** is based on [A Programmer's Guide to Data Mining](http://guidetodatamining.com/)
